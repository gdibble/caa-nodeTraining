#### NPM Software modules used:
- [node-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-static) - simple web server to demonstrate project
- [os](https://www.npmjs.com/package/os) - used to get the server IP address and return it to a client
- [tessel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tessel) - cannot live without it ;)
- [twilio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twilio) - used with a free account to send an SMS message
- ~~[relay-mono](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-mono)~~ - try turning on a rotating light/etc.

## Instructions

1. Get a free account from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com), then activate a From `number`
2. Edit `app.js`: enter your accound SID, token, twilio (from) number, cell number and `WEB_ADDRESS`
3. Run `node server` which you can then view @ `localhost:3000`
4. `t2 list` to make sure your Tessel is connected, then run `t2 run app.js`
5. Your T2 app will noisily output console logs (notice `DEBUG = true`)
6. Switch to your node server and press `CTRL+C` to stop the web server
7. When the T2 app runs `http.get` and it fails, you will get an SMS message
8. *Feeling adventurous? Have a Relay module or breadboard, some jumper cables and lights? Enable the `relay-mono` and `tessel-toggle-power` lines within `app.js`.  If you use a Relay module, plug it into port A as shown in the code.  If you use a pin simply edit the code with the pin-number that you prefer.*

*So now the question is, what else can you do with this?! :)*
