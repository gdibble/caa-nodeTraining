## Instructions

1. Plug your Climate module into port A
2. Run `node server` and copy the IP Address shown, then view it @ `localhost:3000`
3. Edit `app.js` and enter the copied IP into the variable `WEB_SERVER_ADDRESS`
4. `t2 list` to make sure your Tessel is connected, then run `t2 run app.js`
5. Your T2 app will noisily output console logs (notice `DEBUG = true`)
6. Notice that your web page is now graphing data
7. Breath on the climate module; you will see the humidity and temperature change on the web page

*So now the question is, what else can you do with this?! :)*
