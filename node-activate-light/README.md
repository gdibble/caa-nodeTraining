## Instructions

![alt text](t2wiring.jpeg "wiring diagram")

1. Plug your Ambient module into port A
2. Plug your Relay module into port B<br>
    Then wire something to the relay channel 1 or 2 (or both)<br>
    Alternately you could toggle pins as mentioned above
3. `t2 list` to make sure your Tessel is connected, then run `t2 run app.js`
4. Your T2 app will noisily output console logs (notice `DEBUG = true`)
5. Shine your cell phone light onto the relay, then experiment with the trigger-level

*So now the question is, what else can you do with this?! :)*
