## Instructions

1. First double-click `index.html` or drag it into your browser to run it in stand-alone mode<br>
    You can draw on the [HTML5 Canvas tag](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element) with your mouse or by touch
2. Run `node server`, view it @ `localhost:3000` and then *click the link* to go to that IP address
3. Open a second browser and type that IP address
4. Draw on both browsers to have a "drawing war"
5. Go into `index.html` and uncomment the `colorPicker`, then try again

*See if you can edit the code to do something different :)*
