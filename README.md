## node-drawing-game

1. Double-click or drag `index.html` into your browser.<br>
   Notice you can draw.<br>
   Uncomment the input box in this file to add color selection.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your computer.

3. Go to your console and go into the repo directory.<br>
	 Type `npm install` to get dependencies.<br>
	 Type `node app` to run the Node.js server.

4. Go back to your browser and open a new tab to `http://localhost:3000`.<br>
   Click the link in the middle of the page.<br>
   Copy the URI address.<br>
   Now open another web browser and paste the URI, or have a friend go to the URI _(on the same network)_.<br>
   You're now sending events from one browser to the server and the other browser is listening and responding.<br>
   Can you figure out how to send color to the other browser?
